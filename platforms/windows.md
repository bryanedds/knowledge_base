## Scheduling a Task (script) to Run Nightly

0. Start (Windows Key) to open `Task Scheduler`
1. Action > Create Basic Task
2. Give it a name, like `nightly_build` and some description.
3. Trigger the task Daily
4. Select start date and time for the first run, recur every `1` days.
5. Select the `Start a program` for the action to perform.
6. Navigate to and choose the script, like `C:\development\tools\windows\automate_builds.bat`
7. For nightly builds script, start in `C:\development\nightly_build_area`

In the properties for the nightly_build task make the following changes:

* Run whether user is logged on or not
* Wake the computer to run this task
* Run task as soon as possible after a schedule start is missed
* If the task fails, restart every minute for 3 times
* Stop the task if it runs longer than 4 hours

> Note: To edit the task (in Windows 10) open `Task Scheduler` and click on `Task Schedule Library` this contained the `nightly_build` task for me and it wasn't obvious I needed to click on it when I first searched through every folder of Microsoft.

> Note2: It is possible that the system must restart for these changes to take effect. I was trying to get it to work for a couple weeks and then started working after an unexpected system reboot. Potentially that put Windows into gear with automatic tasks, though there was no hint or reason to expect this.
