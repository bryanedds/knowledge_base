## Make a Video

* Define Your Audience
	* Who wants to watch this video?
	* Why do they want to watch?
	* How will their lives be different after?
		* (Could be "entertained in the moment")
* Brainstorm Video Topics
* Story Board / Outline the flow of the Video
* Shoot, Cut, Edit and Finalize the Video

## To Submit (wip)
Presently, just submit via a comment on the ["Challenge 002 Submission"](https://github.com/timbeaudet/knowledge_base/issues/7) issue ticket with the format specified.

Submission process is new and very open for ideas. The goal is track submissions long term, allowing anyone to submit at anytime, link to the project and track the list of things completed. Ideally, eventually, it would be nice to see what challenges a particluar user completed as well.
