# Challenge 1

Be productive on a new, _or existing,_ project and bring your ideas to life. Put in some time and effort into making and track what you've started and completed on a task list to review later.

## Do something, anything, productive!

- Start a new project, game, application or anything.
- Continue working on an on-going project.
- Do as much as you can in a week.
- Track what tasks you finish, big or small.
- You have 7 days to do as many things as you can.

## Due Date

While you can perform this challenge at any time, the projects will be shared on stream October 20th 2019. Submit your project and give a list of tasks completed by midnight October 19th 2019.

## To Submit (wip)

Presently, just submit via a comment on the ["Challenge 001 Submission"](https://github.com/timbeaudet/knowledge_base/issues/3) issue ticket with the format specified.
  
Submission process is new and very open for ideas. The goal is track submissions long term, allowing anyone to submit at anytime, link to the project and track the list of things completed. Ideally, eventually, it would be nice to see what challenges a particluar user completed as well.
  
Objective is to reduce friction but track who did what and when.
