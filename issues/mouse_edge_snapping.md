# Windows 10 Mouse Stuck at Edge

Windows 10 has issue with mouse getting stuck on edges of monitors with a multi-monitor setup unless moving fast. This is because in Settings > Display where it shows the monitor layout the edges between monitors are not touching or "close enough" so there are some empty pixels the mouse has to "jump" over.

To solve this, get lucky by placing your monitors without the gap!
