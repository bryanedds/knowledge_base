  ✔ Run the blender benchmark thing jabokoe sent @done(20200609 19:36)  
  ✘ Detach brio camera and other USB devices (Pro 9000, gamepad?) @cancelled(20200616 07:48)  
  ✔ OBS to use CPU encoding instead of GPU @done(20200609 19:17)  
    This appeared to make a difference when playing iRacing on Summit Point Raceway  
    Though a few minutes into Nordschielife I still got GPU reset.  

  This wasn't working until installing EVGA Precision X1 and downclocking the GPU. This caused the stability to work
  and it seems possible to use the AMD card while racing also, so win-win!!
