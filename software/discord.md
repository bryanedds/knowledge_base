# Discord

## Clear all Unread Dots in a Guild/Server:

Press `SHIFT`+`ESCAPE`

## Adding a Self-Select Role Option for Zira

```
z/channel CHANNEL_ID
z/message MESSAGE_ID
z/add EMOJI ROLE_ID
z/add EMOJI ROLE_ID
```

Grab ID's by enabling Developer Mode in the Gear > Appearance > Advanced.  
Then Right-Click the channel/message/role.

Note: Type these things directly in a channel Zira has access to, I used the Welcome channel directly. If Zira can't chat in the channel you can see if it worked by Zira reacting with the emoji.
