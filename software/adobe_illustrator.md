# Adobe Illustrator

## Tools and Usage

- Selection Tool:  

	**Hotkey:** v  
	**Purpose:** To select whole 'objects' with `left mouse click`,  
	`Click and drag` to move the object.  
	Hold `alt`, then `click and drag` to create a duplicate object.  

- Paste copied object directly on top of original copy, `CTRL+SHIFT+V`
> This is useful for doing shape manipulations with the Unite, Intersect, Exclude tools.

- Move an object above/behind things, change layer order with `CTRL+[` or `CTRL+]`

**Hide Safe Zone and Cross Hairs**

Recently updated illustator and it was showing lots of lines getting in my way, perhaps useful in certain scenarios. To toggle those on/off:

1. View > Rulers > Show Video Rulers
2. Click icon on right side of art board, and deselect
	- Show Center Mark
	- Show Cross Hairs
	- Show Video Safe Areas

## Techniques

### Convert Stroke to Object

1. Select the line/stroke.
2. In the menu use: Object > Path > Outline Stroke

Removing a part of a path to make an incomplete shape (for mirroring or something)

1. Select object
2. Use Direct Selection `A`
3. Deselect all nodes `CTRL-SHIFT-A`
4. Select edge to remove, and delete `delete`

Merge two nodes together

1. Use Direct Selection `A` to select both nodes.
2. Object > Path > Average `CTRL-ALT-J`
