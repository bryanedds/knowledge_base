By picking a language and getting started. Make small projects at first, and just keep learning. It takes a long time, a lot of effort and a lot failures before you will really get the hang of things. The answer also depends greatly on your current expertise and interest levels.

If you do not know if programming is of _serious_ interest I highly recommend using the visual code editors like [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker), [Construct](https://www.scirra.com/), [Clickteam Fusion](https://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-fusion-2-5), (exact software not super important) to start making something happen in a logical way. Once you feel if the interest is there, or not, you can continue with actual scripts (or not).

If you already know programming is of _serious_ interest I highly recommend jumping away from editing with visualized code blocks and such. Game Maker offers GML scripts, there could also [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and other frameworks that you can get started with.

Find a community to the engine/language you choose, browse through their forums or information as most basic questions will have answers.

## Important To Note

You will have failures, and you will find yourself against many walls. Just stay persistent, keep trying and don't get discouraged. Also if programming is not for you, there are other avenues to get into game development like design, art, audio, marketing.

## Project Ideas to Start With

1. Hello World
2. Guess The Number
3. Rock Paper Scissors
4. Tic-Tac-Toe
5. Pong
6. Snake

## Final Note

I have been programming for a _very long time_ and over 10 years of almost daily C++ programming. I still find new things to learn and improve upon, the learning never stops and you *must put in the time and effort.* Learning does not come for free; even paid classes require time and effort to be effective.
