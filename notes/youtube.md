# Building a Better YouTube Channel

## Know Your Audience

- What do you have to offer and deliver that your audience will want?



## Keeping Possession of Audiences Attention

Every ~8 seconds you should change something up to keep the attention of the viewer, else their mind will wander onto something else, a few ways to do this may include:

1. Change the angle of the camera.
2. On Screen titles
3. Cut into b-roll
4. Ask a question?
5. Start / Stop music
6. Crop in/out with the same/single camera setup.
7. Use an outtake, but don't use often.
8. Show a video clip (is this not b-roll?)
9. Add a sound effect
10. Tell a short story... in 8 seconds?
11. Change location with camera shoot.
12. Take video vlog/selfie style for moving background.
13. Interview a guest
14. Share your screen (gameplay etc)
15. Add video effects? (use slightly)
16. Audio effects, like high pitch voice.
17. Black and white / color shift.
18. Add transitions ... really
19. Camera movement on broll (isn't this b-roll)
20. Use prop (again, isn't this b-roll)
