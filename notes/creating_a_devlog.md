# Creating a Development Log

## Preparing

- Prior to starting ensure camera and other equipment is fully charged; otherwise expect delays.
- Get the lighting situated, turn all lights on, turn all monitors off.
- Ensure the composition is good; fill the scene, don't leave lots of space above the head. 
  - Rememeber it is always possible to crop slightly when recording high enough detail.
  - Look for the telepromter being in the edges of the frame.
- Take the time to setup the camera in manual focus mode, turn off auto white balance.
  - Double check the manual white balance, the Canon application made this extremely easy with color picker.
  - This will make jump cuts slightly less obvious from lighting/adjustments.
  - It seems auto focus doesn't hurt jump cuts too much, but auto white balance certainly does.
- Double check the audio setup, when using the sampson ensure it is as close to speaker as possible.
  - Also shut door for AC fans, it helps reduce background noise.

## Filming

- Just prior to the shoot, check a mirror one last time; smile, get excited, breathe deep.
- When making another attempt at speaking through something, start from the top of a paragraph or sentence.
  - Starting mid-sentence is super noticable and much harder to edit away.
- If the camera runs out of memory and shuts down; verify the last thing it saved.

## Editing

- When collecting all the footage, the network actually has reasonable speeds to just copy.
- Leave space at bottom of a graph or image intended to view while paused to avoid YouTube controls.
