# Creating a Development Log

## Scripting

- Do not accuse the audience, it sets them on edge.
- Throw away all extra words that do not add to the objective or story.

## Preparing the Shoot

- Prior to starting ensure camera and other equipment is fully charged; otherwise expect delays.
- Get the lighting situated, turn all lights on, turn all monitors off.
- Ensure the composition is good; fill the scene, don't leave lots of space above the head. 
  - Rememeber it is always possible to crop slightly when recording high enough detail.
  - Look for the telepromter hood being in the edges of the frame.
- Take the time to setup the camera in manual focus mode, turn off auto white balance.
  - Double check the manual white balance, the Canon application made this extremely easy with color picker.
  - This will make jump cuts slightly less obvious from lighting/adjustments.
  - It seems auto focus doesn't hurt jump cuts too much, but auto white balance certainly does.
- Double check the audio setup, when using the sampson ensure it is as close to speaker as possible.
  - Also shut door for AC fans, it helps reduce background noise.
- Ensure the ipad (used for teleprompter) has nothing but the prompt app running.
  - This can negatively effect how well it works.

## Filming

- Just prior to the shoot, check a mirror one last time; smile, get excited, breathe deep.
- When making a second attempt at speaking, start from the top of a paragraph or sentence.
  - Starting mid-sentence is super noticable and much harder to edit away.
- Try watching the clock as the camera only allows recording for 29 minutes.
- If the camera runs out of memory and shuts down; verify the last thing it saved.
- If the camera runs out of time and shuts down; verify the last thing it saved. (29 minute rule)
- Try reducing the length of pause between sentences; at least slightly.
  - This still needs to feel natural, but could be a little faster than how I read/continue.

## Editing

- When collecting all the footage, the network actually has reasonable speeds to just copy.
- Leave space at bottom of a graph or image intended to view while paused to avoid YouTube controls.

## Releasing

### Thumbnails

- Use a face in the thumbnail.
  - This is highly advised, though I believe I've had lower CTR when doing so. Perhaps gamedev videos are better without the face, or perhaps my face is simply too scary for viewers to click on.
- Add Text in Thumbnail
  - There are theories that viewers ignore the titles while browsing and see only the thumbnail text.
  - Keep the text large
  - Limit yourself to 4 words or so.
  - Be consistent with placement, color, font, size, etc for "brand identification"
- Use Graphic Elements to Draw Attention
  - Arrow, Highlight Circles, Price Tags

### Closed Captions

1. Copy the script and save as a .txt file near the video being uploaded.
2. Go into YouTube studio, video details for the desired video.
3. Click show more to expand, then find "Upload Subtitles" and use without timing.
4. Upload the script .txt file and magic?

## Post Release

### Compare CTR of all Videos (YouTube)

1. Open YouTube Studio and click Analytics to see channel analytics.
2. In the top right, click Advanced Mode
3. Use either drop down to select Impressions click-through rate

_Note: another useful thing would be to sort the videos by this by clicking the Impressions click-through rate header. Use the same process for a variety of other stats including average percentage viewed, though I haven't found a way to sort on that._
