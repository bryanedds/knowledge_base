# Creating a Development Log

## Preparing

- Prior to starting ensure camera and other equipment is fully charged; otherwise expect delays.
- Ensure the composition is good; fill the scene, don't leave lots of space above the head. 
- Take the time to setup the camera in manual focus mode, turn off auto white balance.
  - This will make jump cuts slightly less obvious from lighting/adjustments.

## Filming

- Just prior to the shoot, check a mirror one last time; smile, get excited, breathe deep.
- When making another attempt at speaking through something, start from the top of a paragraph or sentence.
  - Starting mid-sentence is super noticable and much harder to edit away.
- If the camera runs out of memory and shuts down; verify the last thing it saved.

## Editing

- Leave space at bottom of a graph or image intended to view while paused to avoid YouTube controls.
