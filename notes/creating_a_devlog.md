# Creating a Development Log

## Preparing

- Prior to starting ensure camera and other equipment is fully charged; otherwise expect delays.
- Ensure the composition is good; fill the scene, don't leave lots of space above the head. 
- Take the time to setup the camera in manual focus mode
  - This will make jump cuts slightly less obvious from lighting/adjustments.

## Filming

- When making another attempt at speaking through something, start from the top of a paragraph or sentence.
  - Starting mid-sentence is super noticable and much harder to edit away.
- If the camera runs out of memory and shuts down; verify the last thing it saved.
