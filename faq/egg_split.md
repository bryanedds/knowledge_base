# Separating [Eggcelerate!](https://tyrebyte.es/egg1) and [Eggcelerate! to the North Pole](https://tyrebyt.es/eggnorth1)

The Winter Eggspansion for Eggcelerate! was much larger than initially intended and was only created as a DLC because there was not enough time before Easter 2022 to make it a standalone game. The DLC eggspansion was larger than the base game and makes more sense to be a standalone sequel. With a future version becoming a standalone sequel it makes sense for each part of the franchise to be similar. Plus this gives Tim another chance to go through the marketing/release cycle and practice for upcoming releases like Eggcelerate! to the Tropics coming for Easter 2023.

## Why Separate
- The DLC eggspansion was larger than base game.
- Consistency with future releases of the franchise.
- Go through the release cycle for more experience.
	- Chances for better visibility, the DLC was hidden. 

## What is Happening?

Winter Eggspansion for Eggcelerate! is turning into [Eggcelerate! to the North Pole](https://tyrebyt.es/eggnorth1)

## How?

Eggcelerate! to the North Pole will be released in December 2022, and for a few days it will exist side-by-side with the Winter Eggspansion DLC; but soon after release the DLC will be removed and anyone who bought the DLC (Winter Eggpansion for Eggcelerate!) should have access to the standalone version (Eggcelerate! to the North Pole). 

This will reset the leaderboads for the Winter tracks entirely.  
It will likely also reset any Winter achievementss as well.
