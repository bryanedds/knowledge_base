# Legacy Code

This is code that was written as it was to solve the problem it needed to solve. Perhaps that does not solve today's issue or has some performance implication, or other maintenance issues, but a month ago, a year ago or whenever the code was originally written; it did its job "good enough".

Every project will have code like this. Requirements change over time, and to solve every problem 'perfectly' would take too much time and the project would never be released.

It is easy to look back and say it should have been done better because you know have information that was likely unavailable at the time. Its also easy say that it should have been done better when you are not the one spending the money to get things done. Legacy code will be cleaned up where it makes sense.
