# What is Happening? (2022-2023 Edition)

A lot. Seriously, a lot. So much marketing & promotional preparation in November and December for the following:

## Eggcelerate! to the North Pole

The winter eggspansion DLC is being converted into a fully standalone sequel. Hopefully to get more visibility, and because it was larger than the base game!! Future versions of Eggcelerate! (like to the Topics) will come out as standalone games.

This will be released sometime in middle of December, [go wishlist now](https://tyrebyt.es/eggnorth1).

## ShadowGhost Pro

Testing the idea of selling things on the Unity Asset Store while also building future tools for the times I use Unity like I did for Eggcelerate! / LudumDare. This will go live December 5th when the YouTube video is released, and it will start 50% off.

The tool helps record and playback the player objects to support time-trail modes and showing the player their best lap in a racing game, or for other games to support the speed running community with ease. Just drag a component and call a single function.

## The Sunday Shift

Starting January 8th at 7am ET and running every Sunday through March 26th I'll be streaming the attempt to build a game from concept to minimum viable product, and if successful market and sell it. This series should allow viewers to catch the full project from start to finish.

## Eggcelerate! to the Tropics

Starting mid-December/early-January this will become the main project and take significant focus and effort. Planned to be released at the end of March for Easter 2023 it will be another big effort.

## Tim Beaudet's Indie Adventure (YouTube)

With the decision to make racing games vs the racing simulator the my developer channel on YouTube plays a bigger role. This means November and December are prepping for, or sharing the information about all these projects while simulatenously ensuring the YouTube channel will have content to feed itself through development of Eggcelerate! to the Tropics. This is causing there to be less focus on programming or design, but I am still learning valuable art skills and sharing my content with the world is the only way to make this work, so I need the practice. Please be patient, there will be lots of focused development soon.
