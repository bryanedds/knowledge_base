# Balancing GameDev as a Business

When creating games we want the experience and game to be as perfect as we can. We want to dig into every detail and fix every minor bug. The truth is as a business you can't do that for a few reasons we will get into later. As a business you need to weigh the benefits and value of each task against the amount of time and cost that task takes. Make each moment of development and dollar spent as valuable as possible to the player is the goal of a gamedev business.

Many things do increase value, like a Level Editor or Different Track Environments for Turbo Boom!, but would cost a lot, _in time and/or money_, and thus reducing the ratio of value to cost. It can be difficult to balance these things fighting within, but I am doing my best.

## Reasons a Business Can't Do Everything it Desires

- Risk in making money back, the purpose of a business is to make at least some amount of profit from a game.
- Each thing worked on takes money and time from the project budget.
- The project scope/budget may not make sense to lift based on market demand.
