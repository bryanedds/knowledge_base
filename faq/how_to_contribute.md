# How to Contribute to the Indie Adventure

## Financial Donations and Support

Thanks so much for caring about the adventure to the point of being willing to chip in. There are many ways to contribute, perhaps the easiest being financially with supporting the adventure on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/timbeaudet), [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=EF6QVSLZS3Q9A&lc=US&item_name=Indie%20Adventure&item_number=twitch&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted) or [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/timbeaudet). There is also a lineup of games to buy: [Archer](https://timbeaudet.itch.io/archer), [Eggcelerate!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1535490/Eggcelerate/), [Winter Eggspansion DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902100/Winter_Eggspansion_for_Eggcelerate/)

## Sharing is Caring

You can also share my stream and content with other players and developers that would be interested in that content. This does make a meaningful impact as it brings new people into the indie adventure that may not have noticed it otherwise.

## Contributing Content/Assets

To contribute with your own creations you must discuss this with Tim, _before_ you go about creating it as is **will not** get used otherwise. By contributing content or assets you transfer all copyright and ownership details to Tim Beaudet and you are _able_ and _willing_ to sign a contract stating this.

Finally, I really want to pay for contributions of content and assets. Whatever someone creates for another should benefit both parties. In present society the most common form is by financial payment. For this reason to contribute a creation you must also include a competitive price quote of the costs to create. _This must not be a 'friend' quote. Do NOT say "I will do it for free."_

## Why won't you accept my contributions 'for free'?

To make indie games as a business it is important to know the cost of a project to make decisions in future projects. For instance if someone gave me a car model for free, then a year later I go to make a similar game and base my projected risk on past experiences I will not account for potentially $1000's and that could sink everything.

If you really insist on doing work for _free_ or a _friend rated discount_ it still requires the competitive price quote and discussing this with Tim. If Tim agrees then the difference in payment will be considered as a donation to the Indie Adventure.
