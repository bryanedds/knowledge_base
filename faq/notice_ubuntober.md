# Ubuntu in October

Some members of the Twitch [LiveCoders Team](https://www.twitch.tv/team/livecoders) is experimenting with running Linux, or Ubuntu for the month of October and I have decided to join them. I have wanted to dual-boot my machine for ages and already had a separate SSD for the purpose, just never found the time or reason. For the most part I will do my best to run in Ubuntu/Linux land for most of the month.

## Why?

* To try something different, learn new things and gain new experiences.
* To improve the user-experience for games built in TurtleBrains.
* Why not?

## Note:

This is not about what Operating System is "better" or "worse". Honestly I find each has their strong points, and each has their weak points. I am not even sure the 'perfect' operating system can exist because the points may be conflicting, who knows.
