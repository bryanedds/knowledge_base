## The Plan

**October 2020** through **January 2021** _most_ weekends will be used to produce videos. I would like to produce roughly a two videos each weekend but with my current skills this is slightly ambitious and out of reach. By challenging myself to creating a video in a day I will learn how to pace myself, and accept that each video can't be perfect.

### Not all videos will be released publicly

Some videos may not be relevant to the audience of Game Developers and will not be released publicly on the YouTube channel. They are still worth producing to practice various skills as that is the primary objective at this time.

## This is **NOT** a Marketing Tool, _yet_!

Making videos on game development is not aiming at the audience that will buy racing games and that is okay. The skills in creating high quality videos will transfer just fine and this is my primary objective.
