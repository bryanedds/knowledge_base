# How to Support Tim

Thank-you for considering to support my adventure, not all support requires money. Share but don't spam. Make sure the community you post to would appreciate the content. For example other game developers may like my stream content, while gaming communities may like my games.

## Ideas

- Create a clip from a fun moment on stream and post it on twitter, reddit, facebook or your favorite social media site.
	- Bonus: Add why you enjoy watching the stream.
- Recommend one of Tim's games on the itch.io forum. https://itch.io/board/13293/recommend-a-game
- Share the time tracking sheet (https://tyrebyt.es/trackerlite) with other indie developers wanting to get serious.
