# Don't be a Backseat Developer

I do appreciate suggestions and tips but it can _sometimes_ feel as if what I've done, and what I'm doing, isn't good enough. When you do give advice or tips on changes, be sure you have a **solid** explanation as to why I should choose your method over another, something that I am _probably_ in the middle of. If I ask, give me the pros and cons of each situation, including the downsides of your own suggestion.

Simply stating your idea and saying "this should be done like ____" is not helpful because I have no idea why it should be that way or what the downsides are of doing it that way.

Finally, if I don't ask for more information, or if I've considered it and moved on in a different direction, let me. I've probably weighed in many factors that might not be visible including the time-cost of changing direction, specific needs already met, or something else entirely. Don't continue pushing your idea or continue listing reasons I'm wrong.
