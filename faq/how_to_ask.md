**Why are you not using _my_ favorite thing instead of _your_ favorite thing?**

If you are looking to learn the benefits of what someone else is using, or ask the question positively without forcing your own opinion, you may need to try asking it differently.

What are the benefits of using C++ over other languages?
What do you like about building your own engine?
Why do you prefer OpenGL for this project?

I would be happy to answer the question if you ask it differently.
