# Why I Write My Own Frameworks

## Important

First, why not my own engine? Anyone should choose to use that which works best for them. The act of creating is what is important after all.

Second, this is a good question and as an independent developer it is one that should be very carefully considered. I have weighed the benefits carefully and although speed and ease of development would be improved, it doesn't fit my long-term goals.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

There are many benefits to writing a homebrewn engine, and there are also many benefits to using an existing engine. Key among them are listed here, although there are many other points not listed.

### [Benefits to custom engine](https://youtu.be/3L6EkTjbbvg)

- Designing a workflow to meet your ambitions.
- Being responsible for, and capable of fixing, bugs.
	- Don't underestimate the ability of fixing a bug vs designing/working around it.
- Having complete control over EXACTLY HOW things work.
	- No guessing, no undesired shortcuts, etc
- Owning the engine
	- Not being constrained in some way or another, or other licensing concerns.

### [Benefits to existing engines](https://youtu.be/kR17Q5eRgxM)

- Saving Development Time
	- Already built, potentially cross platform.
	- Already optimized well, (hopefully).
- Lower technical knowledge requirements
- Generally popular engines have a solid community
	- Perhaps more beneficial to newer developers for assistance.

## The Reason

My long-term goal is to create a physically-accurate, online-multiplayer, racing simulation and I do not believe I can rely on any particular engine or physics library to do this. I want first-hand knowledege of exactly what shortcuts are taken, and what inaccuaracies are introduced for optimizing.
