# LudumDare45: Starting with Nothing

For this gamejam event I am working mostly on a development tool for TurtleBrains.

## A Development Tool?

Yes, a **development tool**. The tool is an in-game / in-engine terminal editor that a user can type commands into. By doing this for LudumDare I am forced into ensuring a good plan of attack for manuals, helpful information and errors/warning display occurs in the tool. This will progress the indie adventure in awesome ways.

## How Is That a Game

Stay Tuned. Seriously, this will be a game by the end of LudumDare 45, assuming all goes to plan.

## Game Objective

The objective of the game is for the player to create a PlayerEntity object in the world and bring that player home.
