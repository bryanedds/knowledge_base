# Turbo Boom! Development Slow Down

Some viewers have made note that the development of Turbo Boom! has slowed down and the observation is correct. In the search for higher quality levels and gameplay I have decided to make levels as inspirations come. To some degree there will require grinding and effort, but I fear that too much will cause lower value for the game.

## Why?

* Work when inspired to create higher quality levels.
* There is no point in rushing to finish (November/December game rush).
* Misc. tasks and projects can fill the gaps when less inspired.
* The project is still on track and **will _not_ be cancelled**.

## How?

* Spotlight on community building projects: Discord, StreamBot etc.
* Throwing around ideas, starting to plan out the next game after Turbo Boom!
* Practicing art, marketing and other skills important for the adventure.
