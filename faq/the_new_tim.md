Hello Turtles,

I have spent the last several weeks reflecting and growing as a person. I became a workaholic. While many use this comically or commend the behavior, I don’t. My indie adventure has cost me everything. Dizzy and I separated and she has Monky and Indie.

It has been a very difficult time and there are changes going forward. No longer will I count streaks of days in a row. This was great to get the daily habit formed, but long term encouraged not taking breaks, all for a number. I will no longer be working on the weekends and instead I will go out hiking.

I’d like to warn others, it isn’t necessarily the amount of time you put into working. I know I put a lot of time into it, but the real issue was it never turned off. Whether I was lying in bed, walking the dog or eating with Dizzy, my brain was racing around on projects. I wasn’t even aware it was happening until everything crashed down.

I was blind to my own values and I let the woman I love down; I am so sorry Dizzy, I love you.

I won’t quit my dream of building my own games, but I will make changes to ensure this adventure does not take control of me again. I run the business. The business does not run me.

Until later, have a good one.
