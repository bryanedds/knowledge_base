# Putting Turbo Boom! on Hold

## What is the plan?

Going forward there will be some engine development then continue the path of building small games that work toward the racing simulator. Due to the experience of Turbo Boom! these small games will likely not be polished for sale, although exceptions can happen.

## Why

* I will need to have a lawyer to ensure I do this release correctly.
* I do not want to go through anxiety of finding one twice, relocating "sometime".
* I wish to move forward with my primary goal of building a Racing Simulator.
	* Turbo Boom! did this well for the first few months, but has been only game focused since.
