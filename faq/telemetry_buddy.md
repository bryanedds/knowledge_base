Telemetry Buddy is a tool for Sim Racing drivers to improve their car control and race with a more competitive edge. It is being built for iRacing which is one of the leading simulators of today.

There is a indicator to show the forces acting upon the car, what the driver is doing with the throttle, brakes, steering and other controls, how the car is performing and all of this is displayed in real-time so the driver can glance and improve lap after lap.

  
### Note:
  
The use of "simulator" in racing simulators is not meaningless. A racing simulator is much like flight simulator, where people take things more seriously than a game. They are there for the experience of being real racing driver.
