- Objective of the day: Display the laps of a full RaceSession split up by mini-sessions (Practice, Qualifying, Race etc)
- Test if SessionID can be used in LapData instead of LapNumber, will need to add LapNumber back if we can't.
- Collect more information about the session status, like the type/name.
- Update the Session Analyzer to display the sessions and what laps belong to what session.
- Deal with edge case of a "restarted session" Practice, Qualifying, Back to Practice, etc.
