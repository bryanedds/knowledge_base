# Objectives for Today 2021-09-08

- Create some scripts to make it much faster to build and deploy using Linode server
  - Basically install git, build system and such to build ON the server vs upload at 200k to it.
  - Why: To make iteration and testing faster than a 30+ minute build process.
- Try giving the cars a PUSH/SHOVE mechanic
- Implement some form of timer for the rounds to restart automatically
- Display the server participants so we know who is on!
- Run a playtest with proper KotH

**Purpose**

Move forward with a prototype of KotH RoR.
