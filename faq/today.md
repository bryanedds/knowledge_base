# Objectives for Today 2022-03-13

## Then later working on Eggcelerate!

- Snowmen / snowball smashing code needs a revisit to be solid on glancing blow, but go poof on direct hits.
- Look a bit deeper into the slip ratio, why do wheels slip so much when car is barely moving but not when it is moving?
  - tune the audio to be more sensitive to spinning wheels, perhaps only on ice??
- Random todos to wrap the game.
- Fix the major issues from last nights play test, (track splits, snowmen that can't be hit)
- Add achievement for all snowmens collected.
- Add other achievements for various tasks (warning spoilers & easter eggs)
- Start changing around the level order, find the difficulty of each level somehow...
- Play through the game to collect all the snowmens & achievements.
- Play through the game and begin setting developer times.
