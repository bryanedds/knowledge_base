# Objectives for Today 2022-04-29

- Focusing on the stability of Rally of Rockets
- Stop invisible / inactive cars from stealing the trophy.
- Nametag color is not changing when players make adjustments (I think it was already sending to server)
- Category carousel borders, sizing and issues; only in browser, and only on Ultimate Games platform?
- Arena is displaying on the rocket selection screen / lobby ??(because of the batched instancing)??
- InGame HUD is rendering on a 1080p target and not using the new "dynamic" "logic" from Lobby screen.
