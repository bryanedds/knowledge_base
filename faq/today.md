# Objectives for Today 2022-07-22

- Add an exception list in the StreamNotification watcher, to not notify.
- Ensure the rest of the ice Cameras are rotating the correct directions.
  - Consider making UnitTests for the cameras to ensure they will always do so in the future.
- Try refactoring icePhysics to get the BallJointConstraint working again without super hacks.
- Likely a short day to hang out with indie doggo.
