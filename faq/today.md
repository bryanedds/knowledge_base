# Objectives for Today 2022-09-06

- Writing a few emails and communication things...
- Math and physics, trying to get a fixed length pendulum constraint rotating!
- Also in need of Web Dev Help to create a simple roadmap page for Trailing Brakes
- Later: Tim takes indie for a hike!

## NOTICE:

Streams will start about 30-45 minutes later than normal for doggo care/routines, and end slightly earlier (around lunch-ish) so I can spend time Indie.
