# Today is 2019-07-27

## Objectives for the day:

- Oil spill gameplay, cause the car to lose traction for X time.
- Add the Alpha notice to the game flow for alpha build.
- Test static physics with moving obstacles for future dev (could be risky).
- Design out some levels perhaps more reasonable to the game.

### More stetch objective:

- Get the leaderboard api rate limited
- Timer on final boom so the player can witness the boom, vs instant restart.
- Camera on wall contact needs to be smoothed.

# Purpose

- Add the ability to compete against others to provide more value for racing against clocks.
