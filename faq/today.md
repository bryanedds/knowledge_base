# Objectives for Today 2020-10-18:

- Producing a video from concept to edit.
- Something about Game Development.
- Ask any questions about my adventure!

**Purpose**

The purpose of creating the YouTube videos on Game Development is to practice. I am still not as comfortable or 'natural' in front of the "YouTube" camera and am trying to improve. I also am working on improving my work-flow to create these videos easier and faster. They are not for marketing my games, but will help me market the simulator in the future.

NEW RECORD: Day 143 in a row
