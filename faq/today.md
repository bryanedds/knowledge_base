# Objectives for Today 2022-03-09

## 8 Hours of Rally of Rockets

- Refactor player settings to use the game save data, and send from client to GameServer upon changing.
  - Get the music/sound volume remembering last session.
  - Get the selected rocket car remembering last session.
- Create an XP / points bar that gives players some form of progression.
  - May need to note how early the game is in development to also reset progression whenever desired.
- Meetings with Ultimate Games to make Rally of Rockets great.

## Then later, probably NOT working on Eggcelerate! this evening, but if I do

- Wrapping up the levels with pretty decals for eye candy and wrapup pass.
- Placing decals on the tracks where bare pavement is abundant; bring pops of color & reference points.

## Coming Soon
