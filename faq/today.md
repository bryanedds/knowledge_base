# Objectives for Today 2022-08-19

- Update the development reports as I've started to fall behind again.
- Refactor the driving_scene to allow multiplayer and singleplayer modes.
- Refactor the Simulator / Networking stuff to mean a Connection is a Driver not a Racecar
  - This will add eventual support for driver swaps in endurance racing.
  - Also means more drivers could enter a server for spectating while not taking the racecars.
- Burger and Friesday!  Around 4 to 6pm ET
