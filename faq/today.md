# Objectives for Today 2022-07-11

- Update the KPIs for the adventure!
- Update the weekly topic on reddit and discord.
- Update the weekly plan for week #28
- Write the mailing list an email about Trailing Brakes Racing Simulator.
- Perhaps look into setting up a new Trailing Brakes website?
- Probably taking a nap, possibly rocket league practice.

## Then later, maybe today, maybe tomorrow...
- Authenticate players with twitch and/or patreon on the GameServer.
- Only if authenticated can the player access the Title Screen and beyond.
- Create a title screen with options Practice (single player) and Competition (online)
  - also "Settings" and "Exit"
- Regular RocketLeague breaks doing "best of 3" in ranked 1v1.

## On the Horizon for Sometime Soon

- Attempting to get AutoBuildSystem to run --test for a pass/fail of unit testing.
