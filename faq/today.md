# Objectives for Today 2022-09-10

- Figure out how to support trees with two meshes/graphics/materials ... trunk vs  leaves.
  - Can or should an iceGraphic contain children graphics?
- Consider adding a spline tool/mode for auto placing objects like fences; how do we save that data?
- Also in need of Web Dev Help to create a simple roadmap page for Trailing Brakes
- Later: Tim takes indie for a hike!

## NOTICE:

Streams will start about 30-45 minutes later than normal for doggo care/routines, and end slightly earlier (around lunch-ish) so I can spend time Indie.
