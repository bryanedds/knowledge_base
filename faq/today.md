# Objectives for Today 2022-02-17

## Block 1

- Figure out what is with the naming of the Addressables bundle, can it be named sanely?
- Make the build/deploy scripts move the Winter Eggspansion addressables out of main build (prepare for release)
- Test if the BuildScript now lets the FlowerZones export/save flowers in Addressables.
- Do all the steps I can to do to prepare for a beta/test build of Winter egg.
- Ensure the game can run with and without the winter eggspansion DLC, find a way to open link if missing.

## Block 2

- Modeling environment props, cabin, house, snow cave.
- Modeling to cleanup the side hill and other track segments.
