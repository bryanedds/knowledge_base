# Objectives for Today:

Today Tim is exporting the models from the art asset pack into a format usable by his Internal Combustion Engine.

- Updating Model Viewer to have ImGui and select textures/materials, perhaps exporting them in json.
- Finding a way to scale all objects appropriately from Blender upon export.
- Export script for blender to convert ALL obj/fbx files to .msh
