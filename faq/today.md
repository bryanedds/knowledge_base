# Objectives for Today 2022-09-09

- Continue adding vegetation/tree brush tool to Track Builder!
- Create a bumpy terrain so that the trees are actually placed on/colliding with a mesh.
- Add controls for density and brush radius.
- Add randomization for height, color tint?
- Also in need of Web Dev Help to create a simple roadmap page for Trailing Brakes
- Later: Tim takes indie for a hike!

## NOTICE:

Streams will start about 30-45 minutes later than normal for doggo care/routines, and end slightly earlier (around lunch-ish) so I can spend time Indie.
