# Objectives for Today 2021-10-07

- Fix the logic bugs with a player resetting a car resetting ALL players flag conditions.
- Get the reset plane to reset the car automatically, it is slime, acid, lava etc...
- Show the boost bar for the players to know how much boost they have.
- Start all the cars with full boost, but remove the ability to gain boost via drifting.
- Make reset take a moment to actually reset the car, this way players are discouraged from spamming it.
- Modify the capture the flag arena to make the landing zones easier to land on, remove the hole.
- Potentially attempt to build another arena for capture the flag?
- Playtest around 12:00 ET. 16:00 UTC
