# Objectives for Today 2021-12-26

- Happy Christmas and Merry Holidays.
- Continuing the Animation MVP, just hacking away to add skeletal animation in some form using shaders.
- Writing an article on Game Development to post and attract attention to stream.
- Probably some Sim Racing in the afternoon.

**NOTE**

- 12/23 to 12/26 are going to be "fun" streams, they may push adventure forward - but loosening the "need to make money"

**Coming Soon**

- Now we play Rally of Rockets from the [Ultimate Games](https://ultimate.games/) platform.
