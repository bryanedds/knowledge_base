# Objectives for Today 2022-07-23

- Fix TrackBuilder and iceModelViewer as they are failing from ICE API changes.
  - This includes getting the runtime stuff working.
- Ensure the rest of the ice Cameras are rotating the correct directions.
  - Consider making UnitTests for the cameras to ensure they will always do so in the future.
- Create a simple cone, perhaps multiple colors, or use the one from Turbo Boom!
- Create a small tool to grab cones from LFS to plug into Trailing Brakes parking lot.
- Likely a short day to hang out with indie doggo.
