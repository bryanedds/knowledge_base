# Objectives for Today 2021-02-27

- Trying to improve Egg bounces, and why they might have broke.
- One last attempt to make jumps exciting and less random success!
- Designing new levels and/or touching up current levels.
- Putting all the levels in the game, perhaps not the right order yet.
- Creating builds for itch.io and players to really hammer on!

**Purpose**

Making Eggcelerate! the best we can with the time we got!
