- Modeling some more on environment props; cabin / house
- Leaderboards on steam and perhaps a handful of secret bits as a "co-working stream" while implementing this.
- Ghosts uploading to leaderboards
- Showing the time of the WR and or nearest competitor to beat.
- Finding a way to build DLC levels in an addressables pack.
- Figure out how to automatically separate the Game from DLC levels with the build and deploy scripts.
