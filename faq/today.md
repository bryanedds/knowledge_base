# Objectives for Today 2021-09-12

- Exploring building Turtle Brains framework as a static library to reduce build times.
- Exploring improving build scripts and to reduce duplication.
- Maybe exploring adding the testing step to nightly build system.
- Perhaps exploring working with and deploying code with a DLL.

**Purpose**

Just have some fun with lower level engine stuff, and perhaps improve Quality of Life with the tools.
