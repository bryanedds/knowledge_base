# Objectives for Today 2022-05-16

- Updating the Key Performance Indicatos of the adventure
- Updating the weekly topic on discord/reddit
- Updating the weekly plan/goals
- Setting up `moose` _(the new machine)_
  - Installing all the things!
  - Misc. fiddling of various settings here and there as they popup.
  - Upgrading some projects to use VS 2022
  - Get TurtleBrains, ICE and RallyOfRockets building with VS2022.
- Setup ssh-keys with the new computer to access hippo, webhost, github and gitea etc.
- Ensure hippo can still push/pull code to github, gitea and other repos etc and jump to webhost.
  - I am 99% sure I broke this with accidental replacement of ssh-keys...
