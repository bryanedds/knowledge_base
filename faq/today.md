Today Tim starts his second attempt at creating an Infinite Runner game in Unity, this time hoping to hit the "record" button before doing so. This evening Tim is checking out AdroitConceptions take at the same runner game and then working on a "How Not To Create a Runner in Unity Video" for YouTube before focusing on art.

- Press the record button on OBS and TimeLapse capture.
- Create an infinite runner with scrolling backdrop etc.
- Car to Car contact, display score and reset the game.
- Playing AdroitConception's Runner Game and checking it out in Unity.
- Editing the video footage from the morning to clip out useful bits for How Not To.
- Working on art, 3D models in blender.
