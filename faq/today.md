# Objectives for Today 2021-09-22

- Add control for camera to press V to go into flying mode etc.
- Add an Orbital camera for when no car is viewable / show the arena in Lobby?
- Go from Connection into a very simple "Lobby" State waiting to start game.
- Add some chat messages / events to the Lobby state / Game.
- Once "ready" synced the timing of all Players to start the event.
- Start a timer in the Gameplay state that counts down, 5 minutes?
- Once timer expires jump into a very simple "Results" State (maybe same as Lobby?)
- MAYBE: CarUpdate packets need to go to GameServer / Players.

**Purpose**

Try getting Rally of Rockets about where it was before this rewrite.
