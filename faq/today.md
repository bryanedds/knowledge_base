# Objectives for Today 2022-02-24

- Take northern woods level and figure out how to split it into prefabs and deal with the consequences for flowers/trees.
- Run through all the current levels and figure out "where we are" with each of them.
- North pole obstacle needs to get implemented.
- Snow cannon needs some polish and figure out how to best place it.
- Continue with prop and obstacle placement in levels, get them looking spicy, 80% of Mount Yeti.
- Make a screenshot tool (object/component) that will automatically flip the cameras, kill the hud, and flip switches.
- If there is time try getting developer mode replay working again.
