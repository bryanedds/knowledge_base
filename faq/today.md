# Objectives for Today 2022-09-18

- Fixing nightly build failures for Rally of Rockets on Windows
  - Will require `git pull` on Track Builder for Linux, perhaps needs to this nightly like TurtleBrains/ICE
  - Also need to commit Trailing Brakes so it does not fail on Linux
- Play with physics to see if the simple tire slip curves can work out "for now"
- Study some maths, practice derivatives...
- Experimenting with migrating SVN to GIT (just testing things)
  - Still waiting for DreamHost help, can't access ANY of the SVN repositories...
- Shorter stream because Tim is still a Zombie today

## NOTICE:

Next Trailing Brakes Racing Simulator Competition will be October 1st at 11am ET.
