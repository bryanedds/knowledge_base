# Objectives for Today 2022-08-21

- Update the development reports as I've started to fall behind again.
- Continue Refactor the Simulator / Networking stuff to mean a Connection is a Driver not a Racecar
  - This will add eventual support for driver swaps in endurance racing.
  - Also means more drivers could enter a server for spectating while not taking the racecars.
  - Requires fixing several bugs and issues to get multiplayer working again.
- Continue refactoring different parts of the project to remove all the cleanup tasks.
