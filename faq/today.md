# Objectives for Today 2021-08-27

- Working on "SoapboxRacer" a quick network test project...
- Truly headless version of the first Network test game in TurtleBrains Playground.
- Test what build types may be desired; debug, release, public and how to deal with dedicated server builds.
- Have to fix a bug where a car is missing on some clients...
- Maybe get to playtest the test game...

**Purpose**

Figure out what works or doesn't in a throw-away place.
