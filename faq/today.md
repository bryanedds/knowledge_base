- Add bullet physics to the new Rally of Rockets project.
- Create a physics/logic representation of the track and display the debug visuals.
- Maybe create some JoinServer handshake to get what track is being played.
- Start adding the rocket car physics/logic separated.

Get Rally of Rockets back to running on the new codebase, with logic separate from visuals.
