# Objectives for Today 2021-11-17

- Load the sky changes into Rally of Rockets.
- Refactor / new feature of allowing an ice Graphic to set shader uniforms
  - This would allow each rocket car to have its own antenna properly working.
- If there is time remaining put the perspective / FoV matrix in the ice Camera object.
  - This would allow TrackBuilder to do the ortho/perspective mode / games with dynamic FoV effects.
- Maybe jump into Blender work on gray boxing an arena?
- There are meetings today, so stream ends a little early.

**Coming Soon**

- Playing Rally of Rockets from the [Ultimate Games](https://ultimate.games/) platform.
