# Objectives for Today 2020-04-13:

## Morning

- Try to boost the Jam Video signal one more time, maybe it can still work out?
- Open Unity and continue 'porting' Turbo Boom! physics, and adding some fun stuff to mess around.
- Keep messing around in Unity.

## Evening

- An evening stream is very unlikely tonight.
