# Objectives for Today 2020-08-20:

- Fixing a failing project in nightly builds on Linux.
- Setup a testing framework (using TurtleBrains Tests) to get testing the physics engine.
- Begin adding and proving out a few tests.
- This all may diverge a bit into just coming up with proofs for future tests.
