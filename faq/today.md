# Objectives for Today 2022-02-23

- 30 minutes trying to download the ghost from the Steam leaderboards, mostly to ensure it will work in the future.
- Grabbing the Leader information from the leaderboards.
- Updating player rank and leader information when the player posts a best time.
- Do a solid push down the TODO list and see what low level fruits we can enjoy.
  - This will also give us an understanding of what tasks need to be cancelled, and which big ones need time given to them.
- If there is time try working on screenshot tool a bit to see if we can solve those issues.
- If there is time try getting developer mode replay working again.

- Continue with prop and obstacle placement in levels, get them looking spicy, 80% of Mount Yeti.
