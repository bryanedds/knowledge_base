# Objectives for Today 2022-03-11

## 8 Hours of Rally of Rockets

- Adding some logging to see where the failure point of save data might be happening.
- Run a test with local sidecar to ensure that part is working as expected (only tested with mock handler so far).
- Work with fllr to deal with emscripten and grab the canvas size so Turtle Brains can know the aspect ratio.
- Work with fllr to deal with emscripten and grab the mouse coordinates in canvas space.
- Work with fllr to deal with emscripten and allow keyboard usage in the chat area of Ultimate Games lobby.
- If fllr is busy, Add support of a Sprite from URL to TurtleBrains.
- If fllr is busy, begin adding nametags and blocking out the Lobby / setup screen.
- Maybe, but probably not, create an XP / points bar that gives players some form of progression.
  - May need to note how early the game is in development to also reset progression whenever desired.

## Then later working on Eggcelerate!

- Wrapping up the levels with pretty decals for eye candy and wrapup pass.
- Placing decals on the tracks where bare pavement is abundant; bring pops of color & reference points.
