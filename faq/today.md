# Objectives for Today 2022-03-05

## Then later, working on Eggcelerate!

- Creating Levels and wrapping them up in pretty decals for eye candy.
- Sound Drops and integration.
- Fix the issue on the Settings screen with sound options not selectable with gamepad / keyboard.
- Begin placing decals on the tracks where bare pavement is abundant; bring pops of color & reference points.
- Consider moving the blue magnet on level 12 back slightly to give the player a little more space.
  - or move the icicle so they can still push the car forward?
