# Objectives for Today 2021-08-19

- Playing with springs and physics.
- Try making a quick test with Euler vs RK4 and the Harmonic Oscillator to verify if that actually works.
- Maybe make the spring constraint use a static body to make the test pass, only one dynamic instead of two.

**Purpose**

Prepare for building an audience of sim racing fans.
