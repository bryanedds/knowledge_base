# Objectives for Today 2021-12-01

- New physics in Rally of Rockets, aiming to get predictable/controllable rocket car.
- Setup a new rocket visual that looks a lot more prototype (like a box)
- Allow adjustment with the width / length of the wheelbase.
- Potentially not using the bullet vehicle physics at all??
- Accelerate to a top speed quite quickly, brake back to stopping.
  - Get Forward to Reverse switch working nicely.
- Turning without losing much grip unless drift/"handbrake" is applied.
