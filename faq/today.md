- Look into adding key-art and other cover image updates on itch.io.
- Writing some more marketing content to post to reddit and such.
- Maybe play with the game manual, if learning indesign is desired.
- Maybe write some scripts for devlog footage now that I'm super behind there.
- Maybe do some stream helper / bot work.
- Practice some speedrunning on later or more difficult tracks.

Start getting people to know about Eggcelerate!
