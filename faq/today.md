## Objectives for the day:

- Do some more bug fixing, polish and etc on the interface.
- Split the car into multiple parts for debris.
- Model the car frame and roll-cage for the death car.

  - Objective: Better alphabetical sorting: `width_length_type_`...  w08_10m_straight ... with `_walled` appended for walls.
- Remake levels. Make more levels.
- Improve level editor... slightly, smartly.

# Challenge
If a level remake (incl. all stuff above levels) is completed before 10am I will do a 2 hour spin off to attempt to record and playback controller data for cool recordings.

# Purpose
