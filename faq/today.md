# Objectives for Today 2021-05-01

- Save the track unique ID in the race session data
  - When loading a race session (especially mock) use this to also load the data for the highlights.
- Create an "Optimal Lap" from a sessions worth of data.
  - This could be quite complicated as optimal lap isn't only the best times through highlight zones.
  - Optimal #1: choose each zone by minimum time in zone and mix at the mid point of straights.
  - Optimal #2: choose each zone by maximum exit speed and mix at mid point of straights.
- Try creating a replay mode that shows this optimal lap, allowing player to rewind/ffwd, etc as it jumps around.
- On Lap Analyzer add a dropdown to "Compare with Lap" containing "optimal, best, lap 1, 2, 3, ... etc.
- Begin creating a Lap Comparison page to show two laps side-by-side, or such, allow selecting each lap to compare with dropdown.
  - Show the lap weather at the start of the laps being compared.
