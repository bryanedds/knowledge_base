# Objectives for Today 2020-04-09:

- Writing the video script for "Everything to know about game jams"
- If you have a question about game jams, let me know and I will try to answer it in video!
- Extra: If we finish the script I will do some art on logo concepts.

## Evening

There is unlikely to be an stream as I will be shooting video footage, or hanging out with Dizzy.

## NOTICE

For the month of April Tim is experimenting with Unity and also focusing more on art and content. For more information [checkout the top secret project announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxdgkWX8rZ0).
