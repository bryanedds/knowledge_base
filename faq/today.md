# Objectives for Today 2022-01-18

- Finish the Keep Away mode by ensuring it doesn't crash in capture the flag arenas (ones without a trophy).
- Create a boost pickup spot that can give a charge to the rocket car.
  - boost pickup should take a moment to replenish (though power boosts without drain at choke points might prove interesting)
- RocketCar boost should speed up the car while driving on the ground.
  - boost in the air powers the car forward like a rocket / glider, almost like double jump.
- RocketCar needs a self-up-righting force when less than three wheels are on the ground.
