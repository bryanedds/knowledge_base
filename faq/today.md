# Today is 2019-11-21

## Objectives for the day:

- Get the monky bird perch game working again in the overlay / bot.
- Add a TidalBuoy command to update / notify what modules are turned on/off.

# Purpose

- Continue the master plan of centralizing the Twitch chat bot so it can run on 'hippo'
- Make it so that StreamHelper is simply an overlay application that communicates with TurtleBot.
