# Objectives for Today 2022-07-21

- Write Unit Test and ensure matrix rotation goes the correct direction:
  - When looking down the axis of rotation, the positive value should be clock-wise.
- Keep moving forward with math and physics for the simulator.
- Create a hinged joint constraint test / class to lock position entirely and rotation to a single axis
- Likely a short day to hang out with indie doggo.
