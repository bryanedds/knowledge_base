# Today is 2019-11-10

## Objectives for the day:

- Continue deconstructing and demolition of StreamHelper moving into TurtleBot
- Fix up ChatServices to/from ModuleInterface to support Discord and Twitch better
  - Discord userID is not a name to use in chat (userNick or userName), Twitch chat has username
  - Discord channelOwner and moderator status (potentially use Roles?, hard-code Owner?)
  - Discord whispers from main channel chats?
- Get communications from TurtleBot (server) to StreamHelper (client) for updating overlay.
  - Send !fireworks through to overlay.

# Purpose

- Make fun stuff happen for the community.
