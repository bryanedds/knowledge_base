# Today is 2020-03-29

## Objectives for the day:

Today Tim will be trying to wrap up the settings screen for Turbo Boom! by getting the gamepad and keyboard controls working fully. Big objectives. Visually the screen will stay as it is, which while not the best is functional and gets the job done.

- Make the tab controls work with keyboard and gamepad, they already work with mouse.
- Ensure the rest of the interface controls remain accessible with the mouse/keyboard/gamepad.
- Figure out how to deal with the text control with mouse only or gamepad only inputs.
  - This may need to go directly into Turtle Brains?
