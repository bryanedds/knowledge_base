# Objectives for Today 2022-07-06

- Update the development reports from Yesterday.
- Add the settings screen from Turbo Boom! or Rally of Rockets to get started.
- Add custom physics system to trailing brakes
- Create a TriangleMesh for the parking lot (or just use a plane??)
- Shoot a ray for the wheels/suspension (much like raycast vehicle in Rally of Rockets)
- Add some very VERY basic forces to get the car moving around (not aiming for realistic here)
- If all that goes smoothly perhaps start on creating a headless GameServer build, and connection/authentication.


## On the Horizon for Sometime Soon

- Attempting to get AutoBuildSystem to run --test for a pass/fail of unit testing.
