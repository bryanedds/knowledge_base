# Today is 2019-11-13

## Objectives for the day:

- Get the TurtleBot connection to TidalBuoy reconnecting (relistening) if it gets disconnected.
- Get the TurtleBot connection to Discord reconnecting if it gets disconnected.
- Find a way for TurtleBot module commands to be registered specific to a service (Twitch only for instance).
- Sanitize Discord messages, ensure to strip @everyone @here and potentially other things


# Purpose

- Continue the master plan of centralizing the Twitch chat bot so it can run on 'hippo'
