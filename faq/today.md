# Today is 2020-01-16

## Objectives for the day:

- Dig into nightly build failures of StreamHelper and TurtleBot.
- Fix and add new things to Track Builder tool
  - When 'dropping' an object to the track surface it spins around 180
  - When 'dropping' an object to the track surface sometimes it scales at the same time; all scales must remain 1.
  - Global "translate and move everything in the world" tool so that tracks can be lowered or rotated for better shadows.
  - Randomize Y rotation tool for subtle differences that are not so rigid.

# Purpose

- Make it easier to edit tracks.
