# Today is 2019-11-14

## Objectives for the day:

- Sanitize discord bot text response, strip out / remove @ symbol, or replace with "@ "
- Find a way for TurtleBot module commands to be registered specific to a service (Twitch only for instance).
- Sanitize Discord messages, ensure to strip @everyone @here and potentially other things


# Purpose

- Continue the master plan of centralizing the Twitch chat bot so it can run on 'hippo'
