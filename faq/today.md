# Today is 2020-01-09

## Objectives for the day:

- Did the keyboard behavior change in the last build of Turbo Boom!?
- Likely caused by adding squared interpolation to the controller.
  - Don't do this for keyboards.
- Also consider a checkbox or something to turn it off for steering wheels?
  - Steering wheels may still suffer from min/max range.

# Purpose

- Bringing Turbo Boom! closer to content complete.
