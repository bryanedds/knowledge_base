# Objectives for Today 2021-02-14

- Happy Valentines Day!
- Quick performance test with the PlacementRandomizer 10101010 vs 11110000
- Figure out something to do with the Punching Glove and Saw
  - Perhaps this will require turning off physics and using a collider to spin the car or something.
- Test if using world up with the egg magnet would work better.
  - This should prevent the egg from being pulled in front of the car, making it align with center of bowl better.
- Test all the new obstacles a bit more and ensure they act as desired.
- Test if Egg/Bowl/Car placement is easy enough before attempting to spend that time and money!
- Art time, make more models and things for eggcelerate:
  - Picket Fence, Signs, Decals (hop-scotch and other chalk like things?)
- Add editor rendering of lines for Checkpoints / AntiCutZones??
- Begin a polish pass through the current levels.

**Purpose**

Make Eggcelerate! Good Again!
Try adding most value for least effort/time.
